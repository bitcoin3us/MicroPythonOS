Future release (next version)
=====

Add changes that have been made to the code but haven't made it into a release here.

Builtin Apps:
- About: show correct next update partition instead of always using get_next_update()
- OSUpdate: restrict OTA update target to ota_0/ota_1 instead of all ota_N partitions (via shared partition helper)

Frameworks:
- Add mpos.partitions.get_next_update_partition() helper that alternates between ota_0 and ota_1 only
- SettingActivity: support slider UI for integer settings

Board Support:
- Fri3d 2026: access expander.analog as property instead of function

OS:
- Disable the repl on hardware uart for esp32s3 targets (USB serial still works)
- Remove big, rarely used font Montserrat 34, 40 and 48 to reduce build size by 218KiB - apps can still upscale or load fonts at runtime

Frameworks:
- `DownloadManager.download_url`: add `redact_url=True` kwarg for callers fetching URLs that embed an auth secret (API key, OAuth token, LNBits readkey, xpub/ypub/zpub). When set, the URL is logged as `scheme://host/...REDACTED...`, the response-headers dump is suppressed, and exception messages have any embedded URL scrubbed. Default `False` preserves existing debug output for callers fetching public URLs (app icons, OS updates, etc.). Use case: prevents serial / REPL logs from leaking the secret-bearing URL even when DEBUG-level chatter is on.
